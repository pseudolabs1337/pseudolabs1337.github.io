★ How to Become a Game Developer

★ Here are several steps you can take to become a game developer:

   1. Obtain a bachelor's degree.
   2. Brush up your math and physics skills.

   6. Get an entry-level game developer position.
   7. Prepare for stiff competition in the job market.


★ Skills and Responsibilities of a Game Developer

Developing a video game requires a combination of creative and analytical skills. Video game developers must work together to develop the concept for a game while following project timelines.

A degree in interactive media, animation, art, and games design, or graphic design could be beneficial if your profession combines both development and design. A variety of undergraduate and postgraduate games courses are accredited by the Independent Games Developers’ Association (TIGA). Working as a tester or quality assurance technician is another way to get into game production. Although you do not need a Higher National Diploma (HND) or a degree for this position, you should have some programming experience and considerable game playing experience.


Any degree subject can help in a career as a game developer.

    1. Computer Games Programming
    2. Computer Games (development or design)
    3. Games Technology
    4. Computer Science
    5. Physics
    6. Mathematics
    7. Software Engineering

Your ability to code in programming languages, such as C++, scripting experience, and understanding of specific software tools are valuable assets. 

A survey from the Entertainment Software Association states that approximately 227 million people in the US play video games, making it the most prevalent form of entertainment. Career advancement within the game development industry can be swift. Most people who begin their careers as juniors get into leadership positions within five to seven years, and many get into more senior roles within ten years. Technical directors, producers, and team managers are examples of senior-level positions.

The basic salary for game developers in India is approximately Rs. 5,00,000 per annum. Other associated job titles, such as game designers and video game programmers, also have similar pay scales. 

    Average game designer salary: Rs. 6,00,000 per year
